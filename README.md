# Kala

## What is this?

This is a fake shopping website built around https://fakestoreapi.com/ API.

## What's the purpose of it? JUST WHY?

I'm more into React Native because an actual useful project in React also needs Backend and has server costs. So I decide to build a fake shopping website, which since it's all fake and pointless, the progression is really slow and boring!

# TODO

## Fix

[ ] - Nav Route History shows Product ID instead of Product Name after navigating to a different router after vising a product page.

[ ] - Purchase button functionality in Cart

[ ] - Back button for Sides

[ ] - Clicking on Fav button in a product in Products Page, also opens the product page. (overlap)

[ ] - Fix UI bug before images getting rendered/loaded.

[ ] - Add Kala logo/text below every Side

[ ] - Search route shows search params after `/search/` while it should be after /`/search`

[ ] - Fix Search Section UI

[ ] - Make Navigation route history (each history) clickable

[ ] - Add price filter to filters

[ ] - making username and user address in header dynamic. (and maybe the balance?)

[ ] - make horizontal margins of different sections (like products list and header) more synchronized

[ ] - Replace manually created SVG components with actual SVG and create-react-app built-in support

[ ] - Fix some icons issue (not resizing)

## Feature

[ ] - Login Page and functionality

[ ] - Testing

[ ] - PWA features (storing changes in IndexedDB, Caching Pages, Offline Page, etc)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
